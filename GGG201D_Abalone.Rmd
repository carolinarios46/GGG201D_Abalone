# 0.0: Data Organization

Unfiltered abalone VCF is located on the genome center at `/share/ant157/students/carolina/Abalone/73-Haliotis_GCA_023055435.1.filtered.vcf`


# 1.1: Filtering VCF

Starting at abalone VCF file that removes related individuals and Monterey low DP samples:
`/share/ant157/students/carolina/Abalone/NoSibs.NoLowDP.filtered.recode.vcf`

Evaluated if there are individuals missing lots of data:

```
#create file to assess individuals that did not sequence well
vcftools --vcf NoSibs.NoLowDP.filtered.recode.vcf --missing-indv --out scorch.vcf

#view the output .imiss file
cat scorch.vcf.imiss

#visualize missing data
`tsbernat@farm:/group/awhitehegrp/joanna/73-Haliotis$ mawk '!/IN/' scorch.vcf.imiss | cut -f5 > totalmissing
gnuplot << \EOF
set terminal dumb size 120, 30
set autoscale 
unset label
set title "Histogram of % missing data per individual"
set ylabel "Number of Occurrences"
set xlabel "% of missing data"
#set yr [0:100000]
binwidth=0.01
bin(x,width)=width*floor(x/width) + binwidth/2.0
plot 'totalmissing' using (bin($1,binwidth)):(1.0) smooth freq with boxes
pause -1
EOF
```
Data is really clean! The individual missing the most data appears to be AWJG01B01 with ~18% missing data.

Next step is to figure out if/how to filter missing data by each population. Bin by ecoregion?
